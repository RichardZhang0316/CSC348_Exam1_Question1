# the first stand-alone puilix super market in winter haven, florida, c. 1940. it is now a thrift store.[9]
# george jenkins previously worked as a stock clerk and a manager at piggly wiggly from 1926 to 1930.[10] when jenkins decided to open his own grocery store, he adopted the name "publix" from a struggling new york-based movie theater company (with 19 opulently decorated movie houses in florida) called publix theatres corporation. jenkins stated “most of the theaters were closing up, and I liked the sound of the name, so I just took it for my store.”[11] jenkins opened the first publix food store in winter haven, florida, on september 6, 1930, a 3,000 square foot building located at 58 northwest 4th street.[12][13] in 1934, that store made $120,000 in sales. in 1935, he opened a second market, the economy dood store, also in winter haven. despite the great depression, his stores were financially successful.
# in 1940, jenkins, called "mr. george" by his employees, mortgaged an orange grove to build florida's first supermarket. on november 8, 1940,[12] his "food palace" opened at 199 west central avenue,[14] having piped-in music, air conditioning, cold cases for frozen and refrigerated items, in-store doughnut and flower shops, and electric-eye automatic doors. during world war ii, material shortages prevented him from building additional stores. in 1945, jenkins purchased the 19-store all american chain of food stores and converted them into publix super markets.[15]
# in 1951, publix moved its headquarters from winter haven to lakeland, florida, and built its first distribution warehouse there. at the same time, they began to close the all american stores, replacing them with publix markets. in 1956, publix achieved $50 million in sales, and $1 million in profit. in 1957, the donut shop in each store was expanded into a full-service bakery.[16]

# in 2011, publix announced it was expanding into north carolina, initially by opening stores in the charlotte metropolitan area,[24] and later announced construction of a new store in asheville.[25] the first charlotte-area publix stores (on the south carolina side of the metropolitan area, opened in 2012); the first north carolina publix store opened in ballantyne in 2014.[26] concurrently, publix purchased seven charlotte-area locations from competitor bi-lo stores.[27] publix completed the purchase of property in boone, north carolina on november 20, 2015, with plans to open in 2017.[28]
# in february 2016, publix announced their entry into the virginia market, with the signing of two store leases, the first in bristol scheduled to open in 2017 and the second in metropolitan richmond scheduled for 2018.[29] in july 2016, it was announced that publix had entered into a purchase agreement with ahold and delhaize group for 10 martin's food markets locations in the richmond market as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the federal trade commission for the impending ahold/delhaize merger.
# in april 2016, ed crenshaw, grandson of founder george jenkins, retired from his position as ceo.[30] president todd jones, a 36-year publix employee whose first job was as a front service clerk (bagger), took on crenshaw's responsibilities as ceo. jones is the first member outside of the jenkins family to have assumed the position.[31] ed crenshaw will remain with publix as chairman of the board of directors.[32]

# kentucky expansion
# on september 7, 2021, publix announced its first kentucky location, expected to open in late 2023 in northeast louisville near the intersection of the gene snyder freeway and old henry road. the first publix liquors location outside florida will be adjacent to this supermarket.[33] exactly three months later, publix announced plans for a second northeast louisville location, this one near the intersection of ballardsville and brownsboro roads in the worthington community. expected to open in early 2024, this location will also feature an adjacent publix liquors store.[34] on june 23, 2022, the same day that ground was broken for the old henry road store, the company announced that it had signed a lease for a future store in lexington at a development on the corner of harrodsburg road and man o' war boulevard. the lexington store, including an adjacent publix liquors location, is planned to open in late 2024.[35]
# response to the covid-19 pandemic
# during the covid-19 pandemic, publix started working with the federal and state agencies and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) beginning in late january 2020. the chain closed food demonstrations, and increased sanitation and routine cleaning,[36] as well as installing plexiglas partitions at registers and customer service desks.[37] as of july 21, 2020, face masks were required for all customers in all publix facilities.[38]
# during the pandemic, publix said it would purchase milk and fresh produce from farmers and dairies in florida who faced reduced demand as a result of school and restaurant closures. publix said the produce, which would otherwise be discarded, would be donated to food banks of feeding america.[39]
# publix started to administer covid-19 vaccines in early january 2021, with a 22-store pilot in the state of florida with a focus on long-term care residents and staff, seniors, and health-care personnel. as of mid-february, publix had provided more than 300,000 vaccines for customers in florida, georgia, south carolina and virginia.[40] publix has faced criticism over its extensive involvement in the distribution of vaccines in florida, including allegations that it had curried favor with the ron desantis administration by making a campaign donation through an affiliated pac, and that publix as exclusive distributor disproportionately favored wealthy neighborhoods.[41][42][43]
# publix and the desantis administration deny that there was a pay to play arrangement; in an april 2021 interview with 60 minutes, desantis stated that publix "were the first one to raise their hand" when florida sought distribution partners for vaccines in retail (noting that cvs health and walgreens were largely focusing on vaccination at long-term care facilities), and that 90% of florida's senior population lived in close proximity to a publix location, especially in palm beach (which has 65 locations, and was identified by the governor as "one of the most elderly counties"). these remarks were not included in the version of the interview aired by cbs, which has led to allegations that the interview had been edited to create a false narrative.[41][44] the democratic party mayor of palm beach county dave kerner stated, "the reporting was not just based on bad information — it was intentionally false. i know this because i offered to provide my insight into palm beach county's vaccination efforts and 60 minutes declined."[45]

# aprons
# publix operates 11 cooking schools under the aprons name.[48] the schools offer cooking demonstrations in which customers are encouraged to sample a variety of dishes prepared at in-store kiosks and take a recipe card with them. all recipes are developed in-house, using easy-to-prepare or prepackaged ingredients, often available at the aprons kiosk.[49]
# in 2005, publix introduced its aprons make-ahead meals concept. customers could purchase meals that they could assemble in-store or, for an extra charge, an aprons associate would prepare and assemble the meals. these were standalone stores located in jacksonville and lithia, florida. in summer 2009, publix closed both locations citing lack of customer interest.[50]
# publix greenwise market
# greenwise market is a retail concept the company introduced in 2007 in response to the increase in the number and profitability of health food stores such as whole foods market.[51] greenwise markets were created to increase awareness of nutrition; products under the greenwise brand are free from added dyes, flavors, hormones, raised without antibiotics, or are usda organic.[52] these stores are similar to the whole foods market chain. in addition to organic and traditional products, greenwise markets include salad and hot bars. the first six stores were set to be in palm beach gardens, boca raton, vero beach, tampa, naples, and coral springs, florida.[53]
# the first greenwise market opened on september 27, 2007, in palm beach gardens.[54] the second publix greenwise market opened in boca raton on may 29, 2008, located in boca village square.[55] the third publix greenwise market opened november 6, 2008, in tampa's hyde park neighborhood.[56]
# from 2008 to 2016, the company focused on a "hybrid" concept instead,[57] integrating the greenwise concept into traditional publix stores. approximately half of locations built since 2008 are considered hybrid stores.
# in 2017, the company announced they would resume building standalone greenwise locations, the first of which will be near the campus of florida state university in tallahassee, opening in 2018.[57]

# online shopping and delivery services
# publixdirect
# in october 2001, publix launched its first online shopping site called publixdirect that would deliver groceries directly to the customer. their first distribution center was situated in pompano beach, florida. customers who lived in broward along with parts of miami-dade and palm beach counties were the first areas to have access to their new service.[76] service was intended to be expanded to orlando, atlanta and other areas. however, the service never saw expansion past the south florida area.[77] due to low demand, it was announced that publixdirect would cease operations on august 22, 2003. the remaining deliveries were made the next day with the remaining orders being canceled or redirected to the customer's nearest publix store.[78]
# publix curbside
# after publixdirect, publix made a second attempt in 2010 at e-commerce with the introduction of publix curbside. customers had the ability to browse and purchase groceries online, then drive to a participating location where an associate will have selected their items and would bring them out to the buyer's vehicle.[79] announced as a pilot program with locations in the atlanta area and tampa, the program was ended in january 2012 after its performance reportedly did not meet expectations.[80]
# the company later resurrected its curbside concept, this time using its delivery partner, instacart, to manage the online ordering portion of the service. currently in a trial stage, the second iteration of publix curbside began with two pilot locations in the greater tampa area in september 2017, and is expected to expand to the greater atlanta area by the end of the year.[81]
# instacart
# in july 2016, publix announced another pilot program with instacart to offer online shopping and delivery services in the greater miami area. customers in 37 zip codes from hallandale beach to south miami are able to participate in the program. not all products available at stores, [such as tobacco, gift cards, prescriptions] and age-restricted items, are able to be delivered by the service.[82] beer and wine can be delivered in florida and north carolina only.[citation needed]
# as of february 2017, instacart deliveries from publix are available in the metro areas of atlanta, charlotte, fort lauderdale,[83] miami, orlando, raleigh, richmond, tampa, jacksonville, and nashville, as determined by zip code.[84]
# later in 2017, publix announced its intent to expand its delivery program, and expects to have the service available from more than 90 percent of stores by the end of the year.[81]
# food world
# in response to other grocery stores' aggressive discounting across the florida market, publix opened its first food world store in september 1970 in orlando, florida.[85] the store marked the first under the food world banner for publix and would become the first of 22 more of the type.[86]
# in november 1977, in lakeland, florida, publix opened the lake miriam food world, which, at 57,000 sq. ft., was its largest store in the company and also the largest store in the southeastern united states. the store was the company's first to feature barcode scanners.
# the brand was retired in 1985 because the stores were unable to turn a profit for publix or give workers a percentage of their store's profits.[86]

# publix pix
# starting in 2001, publix operated 14 pix (stylized in all-capitals) gasoline-convenience stores in florida, georgia, and tennessee. locations were limited during the trial period of the concept. in 2014, all florida and georgia locations were sold to circle k, the sole tennessee location was sold to another entity, and the concept was discontinued.[87] the locations were converted to other brands, as publix retains the rights to "pix."[88]
# crispers
# in 2002, publix invested in the lakeland-based restaurant chain crispers, which concentrates on health-conscious fare. it increased its stake in 2004 before purchasing the remainder of the company in 2007. in may 2011, publix announced it had sold the crispers chain to healthy food concepts llc. the stores had not performed well during the downturn and in recent years publix closed several units, leaving the chain with 36 stores when the sale was announced.[89]
# publix liquors
# publix tested the market response to liquor stores in the late 1980s, but closed its test sites in 1989. it re-entered the liquor sales market again in 2003 and has met with success since.[90] the liquor store is in an area accessed via a separate entrance as required by local laws, modeled after many other grocery chains. all publix liquors locations to date have been in florida; the first such stores outside that state are planned to open in late 2023 and early 2024 in louisville, kentucky.[33][34]
# dvd rental kiosks
# in 2005, publix began installing the new release dvd rental kiosks within eight of its south florida stores with expansion to other south florida stores by 2006. the movie rentals were priced at $1 per day in addition to sales tax.[91]
# following the purchase of the new release by ncr in 2009, a partnership was formed with the ncr company and blockbuster to replace the existing kiosks with blockbuster express kiosks.[92] this replacement began the same year with additional kiosks being installed at all of the other publix locations which was completed by 2010. the cost of the rentals remained the same.[93]
# in 2012, ncr sold its entertainment division, which includes the blockbuster express kiosks, to coinstar, the owner of the redbox dvd rental kiosks.[94][95] blockbuster express machines were replaced with redbox machines in most stores by the end of 2012.
# starbucks
# in december 2016, publix opened its first in-store starbucks location in the orlando area, with five more opening throughout 2017.[96][97][98]
# presto!
# presto! is an automated teller machine (atm) network owned and operated by publix super markets. there are over 1,100 presto! atms in florida, alabama, georgia, north carolina, south carolina, and tennessee, all located at publix retail stores. this network includes point of sale (pos) capabilities, meaning that debit, credit, electronic benefit transfer (ebt) cash, or ebt food stamp cards can be used to make purchases at any publix store.
# working environment
# corporate headquarters building
# the company, founded in 1930, has never had a layoff.[100]
# in 1995 publix was sued "for sex discrimination in job assignments, promotions and allocation of hours" and settled for $81.5 million in 1997.[101] publix had claimed that the suit was simply an effort by the united food and commercial workers to unionize the company, but the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and required publix to "correct some of its statements."[102]
# publix announced that effective january 1, 2015, health coverage would be available to same-sex couples regardless of place of marriage, as long as they are legally married.[103] in early 2018, publix came under fire by the human rights campaign and other lgbt rights organizations for refusing to cover prep hiv prevention drugs under its employee health plans. shortly after the furor, publix changed its health plans to cover prep.[104]
# political giving
# publix political giving is coordinated through their political action committee (pac), which the company leverages to promote business interests. as with other large corporations, the company operates independently of the jenkins family as a separate entity. the ideas and contributions of these members does not reflect the views or business operations of publix super markets.
# according to the miami new times, publix' recent political leanings favor conservative causes, such as opposing the legalization of medical marijuana and the regulation of polystyrene, better known by the brand name styrofoam. publix also contributes to the pac supporting ron desantis, whom some conservatives argue is a business-friendly governor.[105] following the stoneman douglas high school shooting, contributions to other conservative leaders - specifically adam putnam - resulted in local protests in the miami area. ".[106] moments before the protests began, the company announced that it would suspend corporate-funded political contributions and reevaluate their political funding practices.[106] six days after halting political contributions, the florida retail federation, a trade group heavily funded (>80% in 2017) by publix, donated an additional $100,000 to putnam's florida grown pac.[107]
# in december 2020, publix gave $100,000 to florida governor ron desantis' pac.[108][109] while many attribute to this donation publix's ability to provide some of the first access to the vaccine for florida residents, both the governor and publix spokeswoman maria brous rejected this claim as "baseless and ridiculous". publix was able to distribute vaccines to seniors in their markets, while national providers like walgreens and cvs focused on broader efforts.[110]
